# CSS challenge

Use the provided markup in `challenge.html` to create a navigation bar imitating the layout and behavior demonstrated in the screenshots and video inside the `screens/` folder.
You don't have to worry about legacy browsers, the solution only has to work in the latest Google Chrome version.

The challenge can be completed fully with only the markup provided. If you feel that it is necessary to do so, you may modify the markup. JavaScript is another way to accomplish the desired result.

Keep in mind that solving the challenge by only using CSS is what we are most interested in.

Have fun!
